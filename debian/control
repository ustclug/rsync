Description: fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
 rsync is a fast and versatile file-copying tool which can copy locally
 and to/from a remote host. It offers many options to control its behavior,
 and its remote-update protocol can minimize network traffic to make
 transferring updates between machines fast and efficient.
 .
 It is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy
 command for everyday use.
 .
 This package provides both the rsync command line tool and optional
 daemon functionality.
